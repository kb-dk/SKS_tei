# SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard Skrifter (SKS) in TEI XML

# Intro

The material here was translated into TEI from the original kn1 format
by Karsten Kynde with some contributions from Sigfrid Lundberg.

Here we have added xml:id attributes to all elements that didn't have
that to begin with. Makes indexing, searching and navigation easier.

The directories came to our project in a bagit format. We try to keep
it that way for the time being.

There are some ruby tools in
https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/solr-and-snippets/utilities
for validating and creating bagit manifests.
